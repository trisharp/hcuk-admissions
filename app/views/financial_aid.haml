	%h1 Funding and Financial Aid

	%h3 Harvard is affordable
	%p Admission to Harvard is "need-blind", which means that there is no admissions disadvantage in applying for aid. Harvard, like most colleges in the US, has higher fees than Uni in the UK, but for lower and middle income families, financial aid will often make the price affordable, as you can see from the examples below. Our goal in admissions and financial aid is clear: we want to bring the best possible people to Harvard, regardless of their ability to pay. We have a generous financial aid program which awards bursaries (not loans) based entirely on need and not merit, and takes into account all costs (tuition, fees, room, board, books, and travel).  International students have the same access to financial aid as United States citizens. Over the past decade we have increased our scholarship aid significantly -- this year we are awarding over $160 million (about £98 million) in need-based scholarship assistance to over 60% of our students.

	%h3 Basis of awards
	%p All of our financial aid is awarded on the basis of demonstrated financial need -- there are no academic, athletic, or merit-based awards, and we meet the demonstrated need of every student, including international students, for all four years. Our current financial aid policy has dramatically reduced the amount families with incomes below $150,000 (about £92,000) are expected to pay, and parents of families with incomes below $65,000 (about £40,000) and typical asset worth are not expected to contribute at all to college costs. Home equity and retirement funds are not considered as a resource in our determination of a family contribution, and aid packages do not include any loans.
